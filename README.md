# simple_invaders

This was the final project for my C++ class during my 3rd year at school (Bac +3).
I worked on this with Florian ARMENOULT.

The project was to make a space invaders-like game. The name being "simple invaders", and being CS:GO afficionados, we immediatly thought about the player S1mple as our attacking aliens. Going from there, and also being french, we chose to use ZywOo as our playable character. And what better bullet than a chicken ? Right ?

So we ended up having ZywOo shoot chkickens at `a lot` of invading S1mples.

To be honest, I don't remember what to do so that the games runs on my pc, but it was a fun project. And I would like to make it once more (as I'm relearning C++) but probably with a cleaner code.
